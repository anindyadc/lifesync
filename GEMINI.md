# LifeSync Project (Generated by Gemini)

This document provides a concise overview of the LifeSync application, its setup, and deployment process. For a more detailed guide, please refer to `Readme.md`.

## Project Overview

LifeSync is a React application that integrates with Firebase for backend services. It includes several modules for managing tasks, expenses, incidents, and investments, all secured by user authentication and Firestore rules.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (with Vite)
*   **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version)
*   Git

### 2. Initial Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Set up a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Enable Services:**
    *   Enable **Email/Password Authentication**.
    *   Create a **Firestore Database** in **production mode**.
3.  **Get Credentials:** From your Firebase project settings, get the `firebaseConfig` object values.
4.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    *   Add your Firebase credentials to it, prefixed with `VITE_`:
        ```
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
        VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        ```
    *   Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file.

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

The security rules are defined in `firestore.rules`. These are critical for ensuring users can only access their own data.

**Important:** You must deploy these rules to your Firebase project via the Firebase Console for security to be effective.

### 5. Running the Application

Once the setup and configuration are complete, run the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for automated deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  **GitHub Secrets:** Add your Firebase environment variables as secrets to your GitHub repository under `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`.
2.  **Push to `main`:** The GitHub Action defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically trigger on a push to the `main` branch, building and deploying the application.
